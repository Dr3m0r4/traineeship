# MMIV

You can find there what I did during my Intership in the `MMIV laboratory`

## Hierarchy of folders

- curve:
  - There you can find some training results and curves showing this results

- niftynet:
  - This folder contain a modified version of NiftyNet.
  - If you want the original version, I invite you to go there: <https://github.com/NifTK/NiftyNet>

- The 2 others folders contain different application and configuration file

------

The files in this folder permit you to run a `NiftyNet` neural network without too much thinking

  > I hope so
